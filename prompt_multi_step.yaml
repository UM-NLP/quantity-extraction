SYSTEM_PROMPT : "You are A specialized Relation Extraction (RE) and you should detect relationship hierarchy between three types of entities from any given text: measured entity, measured property, and quantity. each measured entity may have multiple measured property but each measured property has one quantity object. I will provide you the definition of the entities you need to extract, the sentence from where your extract the relations and the output format with examples."
USER_PROMPT : "Are you clear about your role?"
ASSISTANT_PROMPT : "Sure, I'm ready to help you with your specialized RE task. Please provide me with the necessary information to get started."
GUIDELINES_PROMPT : > 
    Entity Definitions:\n
    1. measured entity: Short name or full name of a any quantitative physical object or any measurable component or substance. It is anything measurable.\n
    2. measured property: It can be any physical, biological, or chemical characteristics of any measurable item that can be measured directly.. it is a measurable attribute of a measured entity. For example, for a piece of rock, its measured property can be weight, size, density and etc. based on a given input text. If a measured property is given implicitly in a text, generate the most sensible measured property. Y
    3. quantity: A quantity (e.g., '1 kg') is composed of a numeric value and, if applicable, a unit. The meaning of a quantity is often altered by modifiers such as 'average', 'approx.' or 'above'. Modifiers adjacent to numeric values are sometimes included in the quantity spans. A quantity might be given as a range, enumeration, with an uncertainty specification, or all together. Numeric values might be expressed as numeric numbers (e.g., ‘27’), alphabetic numbers (e.g., 'twenty-seven'), combinations (e.g., '2 million'), imprecise quantities (e.g., 'a couple')or constants (e.g., 'room temperature' or 'speed of light'). Within a quantity span, the unit might be identified. Units are often abbreviated according to their symbol (e.g., ‘J’ for Joule). Note that nouns, such as in ‘family houses’, are sometimes considered units.
